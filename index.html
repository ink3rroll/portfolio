        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I study Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Palawan State University. I love watching films, playing videogames, and consuming art in general because I am also an artist myself. I mainly do digital art, but I can paint traditionally too. Programming has captured my attention since I was in senior High School so I picked it as my future career path. Furthermore, It is the only job I can see myself work as a slave and to, at least, retire happily.</p>

            <h3>Replicated Google Advanced Search Page</h3>
            <p>This web page is a replica of Google's advanced search page. Its features use get requests to properly display what the user intends to search. It lets the user input important, must-have keywords, and can exclude specific keywords and ranges to the search query. I used html, css, python and django library to make this project.</p>

            <h3>Travel Log Data Entry App</h3>
            <p>This data entry app generates receipts for every travel made by the employees. The company pays the expenses and having receipts is a must. It makes the generation of the receipt automatic and fast. I made this program using python and tkinter library.</p>

            <h3>Boolean Algebra Simplification Calculator</h3>
            <p>This command-line app simplifies complex boolean expressions. It uses a parsing library called ply, a python lex and yacc library, for its parsing mechanic.</p>
